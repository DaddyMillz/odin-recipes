    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Amala is a smooth, swallow-like Nigerian delicacy made of yam flour, cassava flour, or plantain flour, often enjoyed with rich soups and stews. </p>

<h3>Ingridient</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yam flour (Elubo) - for the classic version</li>
<li>OR Cassava flour (Lafun) - for cassava amala </li>
<li>OR Plantain flour - for plantain amala </li>
<li>Water</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps To Prepare Amala</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Boil water:</b> Pour some water into a pot and bring it to a boil </li>
<li> <b>Add yam flour:</b> Gradually sprinkle the yam flour (elubo) into the boiling water. Do not pour it all at once, this prevents lumps.</li>
<li><b>Turn immediately:</b> Use the wooden spatula to stir and turn quickly as you add the flour. <br>
Keep stirring until it forms a smooth, stretchy dough without lumps.</li>
<li><b>Adjust texture:</b> If it's too thick, add a little hot water, cover for a minute, then stir again. <br>
If it's too soft, sprinkle in a little more yam flour and stir well.</li>
<li><b>Allow to steam:</b> Cover the pot and leave for about 2 minutes on low heat so it cooks properly.</li>
<li><b>Final stir & serve:</b> Give it one last turn to make it smooth. <br>
Wrap in nylon/cling film or scoop directly into a serving plate.</li>
