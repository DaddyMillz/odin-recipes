    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Semo (short for semovita) is a smooth, starchy swallow made from processed semolina flour, popular in West Afriac cuisine. Semo is enjoyed for its mild taste and ability to complement rich, flavoural dishes</p>
<h3>Ingridient</h3>
<ul>
<li>Semolina flour</li>
<li>Water</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps To Prepare Semo</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Boil water:</b> Pour some water into a pot and bring it to a boil </li>
<li> <b>Add yam flour:</b> Gradually sprinkle the yam flour (elubo) into the boiling water. Do not pour it all at once, this prevents lumps.</li>
<li><b>Turn immediately:</b> Use the wooden spatula to stir and turn quickly as you add the flour. <br>
Keep stirring until it forms a smooth, stretchy dough without lumps.</li>
<li><b>Adjust texture:</b> If it's too thick, add a little hot water, cover for a minute, then stir again. <br>
If it's too soft, sprinkle in a little more yam flour and stir well.</li>
<li><b>Allow to steam:</b> Cover the pot and leave for about 2 minutes on low heat so it cooks properly.</li>
<li><b>Final stir & serve:</b> Give it one last turn to make it smooth. <br>
Wrap in nylon/cling film or scoop directly into a serving plate.</li>
